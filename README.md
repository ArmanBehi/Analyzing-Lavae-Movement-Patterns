# Analyzing-Lavae-Movement-Patterns
PetriTrack is a MATLAB-based project designed to analyze the intricate movement patterns of larvae within a controlled environment, specifically a petri dish. Leveraging data collected through IMBAtracker, PetriTrack facilitates the understanding of larvae decision-making processes concerning single or multiple attractive targets.
